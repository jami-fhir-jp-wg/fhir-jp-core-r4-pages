The path attribute contains a [Simple FHIRPath Subset](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/fhirpath.html#simple) that allows path traversal, but not calculation.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"PlanDefinition.action.dynamicValue.path",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
